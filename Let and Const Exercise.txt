Quiz
1.	What is the difference between var and let?
Var can be used to declare variables; when defined in a function, the var keyword scopes a variable to that function; 
var will hoist to the top of the scope it is defined in. You can redeclare and reassign values with var. 
While let keyword creates a block-scoped variable: a variable that only exists inside a code block.

2.	What is the difference between var and const?
Var can be used to declare variables; when defined in a function, the var keyword scopes a variable to that function;
 var will hoist to the top of the scope it is defined in. You can redeclare and reassign values with var.
  While the const keyword prevents a variable from ever being reassigned or redeclared.

4.	What is hoisting?
Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, 
variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
The hoisting allows you to use functions and variables before they're declared.
